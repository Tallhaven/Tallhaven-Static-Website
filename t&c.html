              <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
              <p>At Tallhaven, accessible from [your website URL], one of our main priorities is the privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy document contains types of information that is collected and recorded by Tallhaven and how we use it.</p>

              <h2>Log Files</h2>
              <p>Tallhaven follows a standard procedure of using log files. These files log visitors when they use our mobile application. The information collected by log files include internet protocol (IP) addresses, device type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date and time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. These are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable. The purpose of the information is for analyzing trends, administering the app, tracking users' movement within the app, and gathering demographic information.</p>

              <h2>Cookies and Web Beacons</h2>
              <p>Like any other mobile application, Tallhaven uses 'cookies'.

              <h2>Children's Information</h2>
              <p>Another part of our priority is adding protection for children while using the internet. We encourage parents and guardians to observe, participate in, and/or monitor and guide their online activity.</p>
              <p>Tallhaven does not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13.
